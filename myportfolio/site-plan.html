        Hello and welcome to my portfolio. Web design is a wonderful way of combining form and function to help organizations,
         businesses, and people provide services, merchandise, information, etc. to interested parties. 
         As I plan to become gainfully employed in web design, I have created this web page to show my portfolio.

      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        Hi, my name is Princess Richmond. I am from the Philippines but now live in the United States of America with my husband with whom I am happily married. 
        I come from a large family with 7 brothers, 1 sister and more nieces and nephews than you can count on two hands. 
        My father died when I was little, so I learned to work hard when I was young to help my family survive as we were very poor. 
        I like cooking Filipino food, sewing, going on long road trips, watching movies (especially Star Wars and horror movies) 
        and spending time with my husband, friends, and family. I dislike cilantro, tornadoes, and heavy traffic.
      </p>
      <p>
        Back in the Philippines I was able to work as an intern in the local municipality. 
        I work directly with the mayorâ€™s office. I did some minor coding, billing, and processing of paperwork. 
        I also did an internship with a local company. While there I was tasked with search engine optimization so that 
        when customers were looking for help with using social media to market to customers, we would show up higher on 
        google than our competitors. I also did some social media management with this company.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am currently enrolled in online classes at BYU-Idaho. 
        Sometimes studying can be hard but I have worked hard since I was a little girl and enjoy the challenge. 
        I first started studying programming and web design back when I was 16. At first it was hard as 
        I had never really done much with computers before.  Luckily, I had many helpful teachers and classmates 
        that helped me build a firm foundation on which I continue to build my skillset. Web design has so many 
        ways to create art with code. Which is why I have worked hard to learn how to code and produce beautiful programs and websites.

        Here you can see my work.
        White Water Rafting
        In this project I learned how to make a wireframe for webpages. 
        I created a website for a fictional white water rafting company by developing a basic 
        website structure and learning the relationship between website structure and site layout. 
        With site layout I was able to use my creativity and skill for making sure that the pictures were 
        placed in a manner pleasing to the eye. The hardest part about this was coming up with a color palette using the 
        provided resources that fit the theme of the fictional business complemented the pictures and not obscure the text. 
        The purpose was to advertise and describe our services. And our audience were customers who desire to create memories with 
        friends and family and to go on adventures. I created a home page and child pages.  
        I used HTML and CSS on Visual Studio Code to create the webpage and 
        GitHub to make it a live page on the internet. The images were provided by the instructor.
