                    <h2>River Adventures</h2>
                    <p>Here you can see my work. White Water Rafting In this project I learned how to make a wireframe for webpages. 
                        I created a website for a fictional white water rafting company by developing a basic website
                         structure and learning the relationship between website structure and site layout. 
                         With site layout I was able to use my creativity and skill for making sure that 
                         the pictures were placed in a manner pleasing to the eye. The hardest part about 
                         this was coming up with a color palette using the provided resources that fit the 
                         theme of the fictional business complemented the pictures and not obscure the text. 
                         The purpose was to advertise and describe our services. And our audience were customers 
                         who desire to create memories with friends and family and to go on adventures. 
                         I created a home page and child pages. I used HTML and CSS on Visual Studio 
                         Code to create the webpage and GitHub to make it a live page on the internet. 
                        The images were provided by the instructor.
