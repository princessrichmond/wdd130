                        <h2>About Me</h2>
                        <p>Hi, my name is Princess Richmond. I am from the Philippines but now live in the United 
                            States of America with my husband with whom I am happily married. 
                            I come from a large family with 7 brothers, 1 sister and more nieces and nephews than you can count on two hands. 
                            My father died when I was little, so I learned to work hard when I was young to help my family survive as we were very poor. 
                            I like cooking Filipino food, sewing, going on long road trips, watching movies 
                            (especially Star Wars and horror movies) and spending time with my husband, friends, and family.
                             I dislike cilantro, tornadoes, and heavy traffic.
                        </p>
                        <p>Back in the Philippines I was able to work as an intern in the local municipality. I work directly with the mayorâ€™s office. 
                            I did some minor coding, billing, and processing of paperwork. I also did an internship with a local company. 
                            While there I was tasked with search engine optimization so that when customers were looking 
                            for help with using social media to market to customers, we would show up higher on google than our competitors. 
                            I also did some social media management with this company.
                        </p>
                        <p>I am currently enrolled in online classes at BYU-Idaho. 
                            Sometimes studying can be hard but I have worked hard since I was a little girl and enjoy the challenge. 
                            I first started studying programming and web design back when I was 16. 
                            At first it was hard as I had never really done much with computers before. 
                            Luckily, I had many helpful teachers and classmates that helped me build a firm 
                            foundation on which I continue to build my skillset. Web design has so many ways to create art with code. 
                            Which is why I have worked hard to learn how to code and produce beautiful programs and websites.</p>
